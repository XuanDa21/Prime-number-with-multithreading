The goal of this program is to efficiently find prime numbers in a given range using multithreading in C++. The program divides the specified range into smaller chunks and distributes the workload among multiple threads to expedite the prime number identification process. The solution involves creating a user-defined function, find_primes, which checks for prime numbers within a specific range. The program utilizes the <thread> library in C++ to implement parallel processing.
